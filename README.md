# MAE-298---Aircraft-Design-Group-Code
Code for Team B working on Long Haul mission with reduced emissions.


Code files named:
SA_coupled -- is the baseline for the Single Asile Aircraft for the long haul mission with parameters specified. Running this is on the 2 DOF code in Aviary
Optimized_M_A -- is for choosing to optimize the mach or optimize the altitude based around the SA_coupled code and the documentation from NASA in one of their examples.


"Specified baseline" is the phase info which gives us the highest baseline fuel burn rate with specific inputs from fuel burn. These are from the minimum needs to run and function.

"Baseline" is an average case for flying at this specification

"ASA Optimized" is the best case run at this time.
